            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            
            <p>After completing our lessons on basic HTML and CSS, I was assigned the “Movie Webpage Project” as a way to practice and apply the skills we had learned. We had planned out our story to be based on a well know tv show called "Frieren," with the only main guideline being that our webpage had to focus on any movie-related concept we chose, whether it was a real film, a franchise, or an idea we created ourselves. With this being a project we still had to follow a set of specific requirements to show our understanding of proper HTML structure, effective CSS styling, and overall webpage organization. Additionally, we were required to work with a partner, which meant sharing responsibilities and combining our ideas to produce a webpage that represented a story we had made.</p>
           
            <h2>Content</h2>
            
            <p>For our project me and my partner were put under pressure on deciding what parts of the project to take up as we made our plans. Although we did have a story we already were basing off of we had to take a more original route and make up something similar but also had the same idea behind what made the tv show "Frieren" good. After deciding the plot, settings, and how the story would first pan out we began listing off and doing what was required for the webpage to be well made. As shown below:</p>
            
            <p>The HTML requirements include</p>
                
            <p>Headers</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Paragraphs</li>
            <li>Div, span</li>
            <li>Custom google fonts</li>
            <li>Input and submit buttons</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The CSS requirements include</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Class and id selectors</li>
            <li>Use proper border, padding, margin, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There also needed to be two local images on the webpage.</p>
            
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            
            <p>What made this task as a project so difficult between me and my partner was writing the actual story as it took the longest to figure out how to incorporate the genres adventure with slice of life as part of the story. While I did write the story my partner ahd helped with making it as she inspire where it should take place and how the dynamics would flow, while the story is short and isn't well put together as I had hoped. What took the most for the story was how to shorten/summarize the text for clarity and enough to fill the webpage and sequel. I overcame these parts through going back and rereading my writing while it may seem simple being creative was neither one of our strong suits. Me and my partner had decided that I should focus more on actions rather than speech and how each interaction would end up which ended up working. </p>
            
             <h2>Take Aways</h2>
            
            
                <ul>
                 <li>Communication between partners and teachers are key</li>
                 <li>Planning out a long project helps make it a place to look back and remember what to do</li>
                <li>Always check the checklist for any missing items or things you should improve on</li>
                </ul>
